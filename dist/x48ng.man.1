\" .SH OPERATION

.PP
x48ng emulates an HP 48 calculator. This manual does not attempt to
describe the operation of the HP calulator, but only the user interface
to the emulator.

\" .I Pointer Usage:
\" When mouse button one is press on an x48ng key the key is depress until
\" the mouse button is released.  If you wish to have more than one key
\" press at a time mouse button 3 may be used.  Button pressed with mouse
\" button 3 will remain pressed until mouse button 1 is used.  For example
\" to reset the calulator you can press the A key and the F key with mouse
\" button 3 and then press the on button with mouse button 1.

\" Mouse button 2 will paste the text in the cut buffer to the calculator
\" if it is press in the display area of the calculator. See notes on
\" pasting text into the calculator below.

\" Use of mouse elsewhere on the image of the calculator is undefined.

.SH ACCELERATORS

The keyboard may be used to input data into the x48ng.
The number keys on the keyboard coresponds to the number buttons on
the calaculator, and the alphbetic keys on the keyboard control the
buttons on the top half of the calculator and the @code{+/-} and
@code{EXX} keys.

The @code{ENTER} button is attached to the Enter key, the delete key
to the <-/DROP button and Divide, multiply, subtract and add buttons to
the /, *, -, and + keys on the key board.

.SH COLORS
The x48ng is trying to look like a particular device.
The colors are therefore not selectable.
